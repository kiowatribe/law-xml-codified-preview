Recusal includes no participation in any processes or decisions of the Commission and no participation in votes taken by the Commission during the course of the recusal. Failure to disclose this type of conflict of interest shall be grounds for disciplinary action up to and including removal from the Commission.</text>
        <text>Members of the Commission shall not endorse any candidate or question in any election. They shall not participate in any campaign activities or other forums or venues, including social media, that could be perceived as being in support of or against any candidate or question in an election.
