        <text>The defendant may plead, "guilty," "not guilty," "not guilty by reason of former jeopardy," or "not guilty by reason of insanity." If the defendant wishes to plead "not guilty," he may demand a jury trial. After a plea of "not guilty," the Court shall set a date for trial which shall allow sufficient time for defendant to prepare his defense. If the defendant refuses to plead, a plea of "not guilty" will be entered for him by the Court. If the defendant wishes to plead "guilty," he may be sentenced immediately or within a reasonable time thereafter. A plea made to the Court must be made in open court with the defendant himself in Court. When the defendant pleads a former jeopardy and shall have been acquitted or convicted upon complaint, the conviction or acquittal is a bar to another complaint for the offense charged in the former, or for an attempt to commit the same, or an offense necessarily included therein of which he might have been convicted under that complaint.</text>

        <text><u>REASONABLE DOUBT; DEFENDANT'S REFUSAL TO TESTIFY; DEFENDANT'S WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE PRESENT</u>. A defendant in a criminal action need not testify and is presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proven. The effect of this presumption is only to place upon the Tribe the burden of proving him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant's failure to testify on his own behalf shall in no way be construed against him nor commented upon by the Tribe. When a defendant has waived his right to be present at trial, the Court, in its discretion, may allow the Tribe to comment upon the defendant's absence and waiver.</text>

      <heading>FINDINGS BY THE COURT.</heading>
      <text>In cases tried without a jury, and except in cases where a party defaults, fails to appear or otherwise waives such, findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be made by the court in support of all final judgments. Upon its own motion or the motion of any party within ten days of the entry of judgment, findings may be amended or added to and the judgment may be amended accordingly.</text>

        <text>Habeas Corpus. Appropriate relief by habeas corpus proceedings shall be granted whenever it appears to the court that any person is unjustly imprisoned or otherwise unjustly restrained of his liberty. Upon the filing of the complaint the court shall, unless it appears from such complaint or the showing of the plaintiff that he is not entitled to any relief, issue a writ directed to the defendant commanding him to bring the person alleged to be restrained before the court at a time and place therein specified, at which time the Court shall proceed in a summary manner to hear the matter and render judgment accordingly. If the writ is not issued, the court shall state its reasons in writing and file the same with the complaint and shall deliver a copy thereof to the plaintiff. If the defendant cannot be found, or if he does not have such person in custody, the writ (and any other process issued) may be served upon any one having such person in custody, in the manner and with the same effect as if he had been made defendant. in the action.</text>
        <text>The defendant shall appear at the proper time and place with the person designated or show good cause for not doing so and must answer the complaint within the time allowed. The answer must state plainly and unequivocally whether he then has, or at any time has had the person designated under this control and restraint, and if so, the cause thereof. If such person has been transferred, the defendant must state that fact, and to whom, when the transfer was made, and the reason or authority therefor. The writ shall not be disobeyed for any defect of form or mis-description of the person restrained or the defendant, if enough is stated to show the meaning and intent thereof.</text>
        <text>The person restrained may waive his right to be present at the hearing, in which case the writ shall be modified accordingly. Pending a determination of the matter the court may place such person in the custody of such individual or individuals as may be deemed proper.</text>
