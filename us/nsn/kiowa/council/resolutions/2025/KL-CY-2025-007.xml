        <strong>Mission statement of the Kiowa Education Agency</strong>
      </text>
      <text><strong>T</strong>he Kiowa Education Agency, established August 13<sup>th</sup>, 2022, has become a fundamental agency for personal growth and self-discovery, enabling Kiowa citizens to reach their full potential and contribute meaningfully to family and community. The rich cultural heritage of the Kiowa people is integral to our identity, and preserving our heritage is essential for the continuation of our traditions, language, and ways of life. One of our guiding principles is that the pursuit of education should not be misconstrued as a departure from our cultural roots or as an adoption of colonial or Western values. Our collective goals affirm the role of education in concert with personal growth and Kiowa identity. Education, as pursued by the Kiowa people, is a means to strengthen and enhance our identity, equipping us to preserve and promote our language, culture, and traditions in a rapidly changing world. The sector of our tribal organization that is solely dedicated to the personal growth, learning, and development of the Kiowa people is the Kiowa Education Agency. The Kiowa Education Agency reaffirms its commitment to integrating Kiowa cultural values, language, and teachings into educational efforts, ensuring that learning is a complimentary path to both personal development and cultural preservation. A core goal of the Kiowa Education Agency is to create spaces for the inclusion and prominence of Kiowa cultural values, language, history, art, culture, teachings and contemporary life as an act of sovereignty. Through Kiowa-centered and holistic approaches we embrace education an act of empowerment, allowing us to navigate diverse spaces while remaining grounded in our Kiowa identity. For all operations and decisions, education is declared as a vital component of cultural reclamation and sustainability, language continuance, resilience, and the continuous evolution of our Kiowa people.</text>
