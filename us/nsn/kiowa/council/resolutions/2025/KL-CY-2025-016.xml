      <text>The Bank is designated as a depository for the funds of the Kiowa Tribe and is to provide other financial accommodations as indicated by this Resolution;</text>
      <text>This Resolution shall continue to be in full force and effect until express written notice of its recission or modification has been received and recorded by the Bank.  Any revocation, modification or replacement of this resolution must be accompanied by a Resolution from the Legislature, duly promulgated, bearing signatures showing passage, agreement by the Chairman, or a veto-override by the Legislature, and also bearing the official seal of the Legislature;</text>
      <text>The signature of an Agent named this resolution is conclusive evidence of their act on behalf of the Kiowa Tribe subject to the powers and limitations set out above.  Any Agent, so long as they act in a representative capacity as an Agent of the Tribe, is authorized to make any and all other contracts, agreements, stipulations and orders with the Bank which may from time to time be necessary and appropriate to effectuate their authority; however, a signatory may not expand his authority beyond the limits set out in this resolution;</text>
      <text>All transactions, if any, with respect to any deposits, withdrawals, rediscounts, and borrowings by or on behalf of the Tribe with the Bank prior to the adoption of this resolution which have been accounted for to the Legislature in the annual budget process and which have passed review by an independent auditor are hereby ratified, approved and confirmed.</text>
      <text>If signed in accordance with this Resolution, the Bank shall debit or credit the Tribe's account in accord with any agreement between the Tribe and the Bank.  The Bank may also charge the Tribe for all necessary and usual expenses that are set out in any agreement with the Tribe, including checks, drafts, or other orders for the payment of money so long as the charges are reasonable, and comply with the requirements of Kiowa, Federal or any applicable State law and are not deemed illegal or improper by any Court of Law.</text>
      <text>The Tribe acknowledges and agrees that the Bank may furnish at its discretion automated access devices to Agents of the Tribe to facilitate those powers authorized by this resolution or other resolutions in effect at the time of issuance. The term "automated access device" includes, but is not limited to, purchase cards (aka "P-cards), credit cards, automated teller machines (ATM), debit cards, and electronic access to records and statements.</text>
