      <text>This Statute shall be called the Kiowa Housing Law.</text>
      <text>Notice to Legislative History: The first tribal legislation concerning the Kiowa Tribe Housing Authority is the KIOWA TRIBE HOUSING AUTHORITY REFORM ACT OF 2017, which authorized the Kiowa Tribe to reform the Tribe's Housing Authority to bring it into compliance with the Constitution and laws of the Tribe, to take full responsibility to assert the Tribe's sovereign authority to address the housing needs of Members of the Tribe, and to abolish the outdated method of subjecting the Tribe's Housing sovereign status to the full or partial control of the State of Oklahoma by operating the Tribe's Housing Authority, in whole or in part, as a State Agency and to assume total assets of the Kiowa Housing Authority. The second piece of tribal legislation on the issue is the Kiowa Tribe Housing Authority Act of 2019. This amendment is made in 2022 to fix certain errors and inaccuracies as noted below. Two versions of this Law are provided. First is one showing the changes, where additions are underlined. The second version is merely clean, where all changes are accepted and it is the clean version which is the official Kiowa Housing Law.</text>

The Legislature therefore created the Kiowa Tribe Housing Authority (hereinafter referred to as the Authority) which is an agency of the Kiowa Tribe having the purposes, powers, and duties as herein or hereafter by law. The Legislature also created the Kiowa Housing Commission as a Constitutional Commission to direct the affairs of the Authority.</text>
