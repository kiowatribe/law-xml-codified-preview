          <heading>Purpose.</heading>
          <text>The Tribe recognizes that, on rare occasions, employees and government officials and appointees may have an extraordinary personal financial need that is unable to be met by the traditional finance system. In addition, the Tribe is aware of the predatory nature of some pay day and title loan firms that entrap individuals who turn to those lending sources. As a response to this unmet need, the Tribe authorizes Employers to develop, offer and implement Financial Hardship Programs.</text>
