        <text>If a Designated Insider violates the Restrictive Covenant and the Corporation initiates legal action for injunctive or other relief, the Corporation shall not, as a result of the time involved in obtaining such relief, be deprived of the benefit of the full period of the Restrictive Covenant. Accordingly, the Restrictive Covenant shall be deemed to have the duration specified in this Section 2 computed from the date the relief is granted. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the foregoing Restrictive Covenant shall not prohibit a Designated Insider from owning directly or indirectly capital stock or similar securities, which are listed on a securities exchange or quoted on the NASDAQ, which do not represent more than one percent (1%) of the outstanding capital stock of any Competing Entity.</text>

If any court determines that any of the agreements, representations and covenants of this Appendix A, or any part thereof, are invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Appendix A shall not thereby be affected and shall be given full effect, without regard to the invalid or unenforceable portions and such invalid or unenforceable portions shall be deemed, without further action on the part of the Corporation and Insider, modified, amended and limited to the extent necessary to render the same valid and enforceable in such jurisdiction. Moreover, if any court determines that any of the agreements, representations or covenants of this Appendix A, or any part thereof, are unenforceable because of the duration or geographic scope of such provisions, such court shall have the power to reduce the duration or scope of such provision, as the case may be, and, in its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable.</text>
