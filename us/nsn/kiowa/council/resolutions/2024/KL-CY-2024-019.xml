    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text> the Kiowa Tribe is a federally recognized Indian Tribe with a Constitution approved by the Secretary of the Interior; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text> the Legislature, is vested with the authority to pass laws and resolutions pursuant to <cite doc="Constitution of the Kiowa Tribe">Article VI, Section 6 (a) of the Constitution of the Kiowa Tribe</cite>; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text> the Legislature, is authorized under the Kiowa Constitution and is empowered to promulgate and enforce codes and laws, to protect Kiowa Tribal Citizens; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text> assimilation and "civilization" processes against Native Americans, such as the Indian Boarding School Policies and Practices, were adopted by the United States to strip American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children of their Indigenous identities, beliefs, and languages; to assimilate them into non-Native culture through federally funded and controlled Christian-run schools, which had the intent and, in many cases, the effect, of termination, with dire and intentional consequences on the cultures and languages of Indigenous Peoples; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text> more than 100,000 American Indian and Alaska Native children were forcibly removed from their family homes and placed in any of 460 Bureau of Indian Affairs-operated schools, including at least 367 known Indian boarding schools, often church-run, at which assimilation and "civilization" practices were inflicted on those children as part of the federal government's goal of advancing eradication of Indigenous Peoples in the United States; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text> the United States Indian Boarding School policy's deliberate intent was to separate Native American children from their families, cultures, communities, and Tribal Nations through removal and reeducation; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text> a boarding school was located here on the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache, Reservation and many Kiowa Tribal children were sent here, and this boarding school and others schools were a place(s) to experiment on and abuse our children medically, physically, psychologically, and sexually; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text> many Kiowa Tribal children were sent to boarding schools that served as a place to experiment on and abuse our children medically, physically, psychologically, and sexually; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text> the 2018 Broken Promises Report published by the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights reported that American Indian and Alaska Native Peoples continue to experience intergenerational trauma resulting from experiences in Indian boarding schools, which divided families, undermined cultural and societal structures, damaged Indigenous identities, and inflicted chronic psychological damage to American Indian and Alaska Native children and families; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text> Indian Boarding School policies have had lasting negative impacts on the Kiowa Tribe, and have drastically reduced our community's language fluency, and limited many of our families' social cohesion and advancement; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text> Congress introduced legislation titled: To establish the Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies in the United States, and for other purposes, the Act may be cited as the "Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies Act" on September 30, 2024, the National Day of Remembrance for U.S. Indian Boarding Schools.; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text> the purposes of <cite path="">this Act</cite> are to establish a Truth and Healing Commission (Commission) on Indian Boarding School Policies and Practices in the United States to formally investigate and document, for the first time in history, the attempted termination of cultures and languages of Indigenous Peoples, assimilation practices, and human rights violations that occurred against American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians through Indian Boarding School Policies in furtherance of the motto to "kill the Indian in him and save the man"; and to formally investigate and document the impacts and ongoing effects of historical and intergenerational trauma in Native communities, including the effects of the attempted cultural and linguistic termination of American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians, resulting from Indian Boarding School Policies, among other things; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text> the Commission's main role is to develop recommendations on actions the federal government can take to adequately hold itself accountable for, and redress and heal, the historical and intergenerational trauma inflicted by the Indian Boarding School Policies and Practices.</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED</conjunction>
      <text> by the Kiowa Tribe Legislature hereby supports congressional efforts to pass legislation approving the Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies and Practices Act and bolstering initiatives, and subsequent recommendations, to hold the federal government accountable for, and redress and heal, the historical and intergenerational trauma inflicted by the Indian Boarding School Policies and Practices.</text>
